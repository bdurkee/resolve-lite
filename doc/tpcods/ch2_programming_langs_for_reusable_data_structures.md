# 2 Programming Langugages for Reusable Data Structures

## Generic Facilities

A satisfactory programming language for data structures must at a minimum include an encapsulating construct that
allows implementers to change the realization chosen for a data structure without affecting the users of the structure.
We can illustrate how this might be accomplished by considering a facility for manipulating stacks of integers.

<pre><code>
<span class="code-comment"># Ignore the fact this is Perl, and pretend it's some unheard-of language</span>
<span class="code-keyword">our</span> <span class="code-variable">$site</span> = <span class="code-string">"needs this"</span>;
</code></pre>
