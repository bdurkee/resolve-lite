# Formal Specification Languages

## Describing the world

Software systems are typically embedded in environments that can be arbitrarily strange and complex. In order to make a
proposed software system work properly, it is necessary at a minimum to determine which aspects of its environment
are relevant to its operation. A formal model of the environment can then be constructed and combined with a formal
model of the proposed software to determine whether the software would interact with its environment to produce
desirable behavior.
